This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript where type coercion can lead to runtime errors that are not caught during compilation.  The `add` function is designed to add two numbers, but due to TypeScript's flexibility with type coercion, it will accept a string and a number.  While the code compiles without error, attempting to execute the function with mismatched types will result in a runtime exception. The solution shows how to use type guards to prevent this error.
